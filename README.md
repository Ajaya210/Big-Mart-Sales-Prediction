# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
Project Title:
BigMart Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Summary:
The retail industry relies heavily on accurate sales forecasts to manage inventory, plan marketing strategies, and optimize operations. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to forecast sales for BigMart outlets using historical sales data. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide actionable insights that help BigMart improve sales performance and decision-making processes.

Goal of the Project:
To build a predictive model that accurately forecasts sales for BigMart outlets, enabling better inventory management, marketing strategies, and operational planning.

Process:
Data Collection:

Collected historical sales data from various BigMart outlets, including information on products, stores, and sales.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing values, treated outliers, performed feature engineering, and prepared the data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conducted EDA to understand data distributions, identify patterns, and uncover relationships between variables.

Feature Engineering:

Created new features to improve the model's predictive power, such as product visibility, store age, and product categories.

Model Building:

Developed various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, to predict sales.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and selected the best-performing model.

Deployment:

Deployed the final model and created a dashboard for visualization using tools like Power BI to showcase predictions and insights.

Details of the Features:
Item Visibility: Impact of product visibility on sales.

Item MRP (Maximum Retail Price): Effect of pricing strategy on sales.

Outlet Establishment Year: Influence of store age on sales.

Outlet Type and Size: Impact of different outlet types and sizes on sales.

Item Type: Categorization of items into various types (e.g., Food, Drinks, Non-Consumables) and their influence on sales.

Skills Used:
Programming: Python, Pandas, NumPy

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, regression models

Data Analysis: Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering

Problem Statement:
The retail industry is dynamic and fast-paced, requiring accurate sales forecasts to manage inventory and plan effectively. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can forecast sales for BigMart outlets, providing insights that help improve inventory management, marketing strategies, and operational planning.
